# Python Mini Projects


A collection of simple Python projects I am building to refresh and 
strenthen my programming foundations.
These mini projects focus on variables, functions, loops, conditionals, user input, and basic problem solving.

## 📂 Projects Included

### **1. calculator.py**

A simple command-line calculator that performs:
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

Great for practicing functions, conditionals, and input validation.


### **2. intro_project.py**
A basic introduction program that:
- Prints personalized information  
- Demonstrates variables, strings, and simple output formatting  

This serves as the starting point of my Python learning journey.
